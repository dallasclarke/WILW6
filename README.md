## Loops: For & While.

Loops are used for repeated actions and are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

- "While" syntax goes as the following:
  while (condition){
      **Code goes here**
      i++
  }
  The example will execute as long as the *condition* returns true. 

  - "For" loop is used as followed:
    
    for (begin; condition; step) {
        **Code**
    }

    Breakdown:

    - Begin: Executes once upon entering the loop.
    - Condition: Checked each loop iteration and once false it stops.
    - Step: Executes after each iteration (Ex. i++)
  

  ## Arrays

  An *Array* is used to store multiple values. You can have a list of items in a single variable.

  Example: 

  let list = [itemOne, itemTwo]

  You can access array elements by by using numbers like this:

  list[0];

  **Array Methods**

  - concat() Merge two or more arrays and returns a new array.
  - splice() Adds/Removes elements from array.
  - unshift() Adds new element to the beginning of an array.
  - slice() Selects a part of an array and returns the new array.
  - pop() Removes the last element of an array.
  - push() Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
  - join () Joins all elements of an array into a string.
